    "An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object.</li><li>\n",

    "As many houses can be made from a house's blueprint, we can create many objects from a class. </li><li>Object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.</li>\n",

    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.</li>\n",

    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. </li></ul>"
